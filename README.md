# ToDoList
This is a ToDo List application designed to create, view and delete tasks.

As it is a maven based application, it should be able to be build with the command:
mvn clean install 
If you are using a IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ , you just need to run the ToDoListApplication.

In the application.properties a hibernate ddl property was added which will ensure that the data persists even after application restart.


With more time, a client side could also be created and integrated with it.
